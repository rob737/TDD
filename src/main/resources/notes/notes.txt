Unit testing is basically testing the smallest component like functions etc individually.
Integration testing is basically testing the overall flow where in multiple components are involved.

Libraries for unit testing :
1. junit :
creating test cases, assertions etc.

2. Mockito :
creating mocks and stubs to mock external dependency that need not be tested as part of
unit testing.

e.g. db connection need not be tested if we are testing data fetch from db.

-- Maven scope:

<scope>test</scope>
It signifies that this dependency is used only for testing purposes and
isn't needed during normal execution.

mvn clean test : command to run test cases.


---- TDD (Test Driven Development)
TDD is basically following below 3 steps in loop :
1. Write a failing test
2. Write main business code to pass the test
3. Refactor and repeat until acceptable level is reached.
